# Community Guidelines
Camping is a kind and inclusive community. We operate by consensus. Technical decisions are meant to be made by group. 

## Diversity Equity Inclusion
Camping is an Anti-Racist, Diverse, and Inclusive community. This is intentional. We prioritize support and safety for folx from under-represented backgrounds, Oppressed groups, and financially burdened individuals. We recognize that the Tech industry, Open Source organizations, and society generally are Racist and exploitive by their nature. Systems, Institutions, and Polices are designed, explicitely and implicitly, to oppress. Hell!; Technology **itself** is a powerful lever that mostly helps to entrench those in power.

So the statement to foster and cultivate an anti-racist, diverse, and inclusive community is imperative and intentional. We want the future to be more equitable, more fair, and more beautiful for all people.

## Tenets
- Diversity Equity Inclusion.
- Maintain a kind and supportive community environment. Be Kind to others.
- Prioritize the education and support of junior developers and designers. Especially complete beginners.
- Recognize that honesty among groups is achieved when people feel safe to share their opinions, and trust that they won't be ridiculed or insulted.
- Exclusionary and bigotted opinions that racial or ethnic groups are lesser, less qualified, or inferior are not tolerated.
- Opinions that limit the speech of others based on perceived merit are not tolerated.
- Foster broad inclusion. Endeavour to maintain documentation and communication parity across English, Spanish, and the Japanese languages.
- Consensus and democratic stewardship.
- Don't assume consensus from silence.
- Prioritize the safety and inclusion of under-represented and oprressed groups.
- Camping has a big tent policy. Nazi's and Fascists are not allowed in the tent. They want to tear the tent down.
- Dominant or over-represented groups have power, and equity can't be achieved unless that power is ceded to under-represented and oprressed people.
- We understand that an absence of hiearchy or leadership just means that power is held implicitely by a few, and not explicitely. Strive to expose, flatten, and spread community power.
- _why was weird, and we can be weird too.

## Strategies
- Maintain Documentation parity across 3 languages.
- Maintain exhaustive documentation and guides to learn, develop, and deploy Camping. Include extensive guides on HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and other technologies and practices that are needed to build websites.
- Pay contributors to maintain and improve Camping according to consensus.
- Prioritize helping folx from under-represented and oppressed groups to contribute to Camping by providing: Support, Code Reviews, Technical direction, and financial compensation.
- Helping new designers and engineers grow their skills and confidence, and to find work if they wish, is a priority. Especially if they are from an under-represented group.
- Maintain a Macro, Modifiable architecture to give space for anybody to Contribute to Camping without requiring sweeping or broad changes to Camping's core architecture.
- Foster and cultivate community connections across the industry to find employment and organizations that are safe and equitable for folx to join.
