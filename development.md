# Development list
- [x] Fix Autoloader and reloader to respect environment.
- [x] Work out Zeitwerk autoloading kinks.
- [ ] Eager Load the apps stuff. (Eager load controllers in order before building the routing tree thingy so that apps and their routes will be set up correctly.)

# to run the app in rerun mode:
run: `rerun bin/camping` to start the app in a hot reloadable fashion.
